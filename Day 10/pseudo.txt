-Assume routes don't intersect

Find start pos
Add start pos to check queue

While loop not found:
    Get next route on list
    For each direction in curr pipe:
        If backtracking or point in route and not starting:
            continue
        If pipes connect:
            Update route with new point
            Check if at the starting point:
                return this route
            Add new point and route to queue

Check current and previous row point 
If theres gap
    add to count
    wait until another gap found
Otherwise 
    Go to next value
